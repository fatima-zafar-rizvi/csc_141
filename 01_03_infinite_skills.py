# I will be writing about my future aspirations for when I have infinite coding skills.

If I had infinite coding skills I would like to build an expense tracker app for myself since I am not great with handling my money.

Since I am a computer science and business administration major I would also like to create an AI powered market analysis tool.

Also, I would want to build an AI powered CRM system for either a company or if I would have my own business/company at that point in time then I would create it for myself.
