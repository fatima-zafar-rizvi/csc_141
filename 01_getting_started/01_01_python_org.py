# My first ever code!

'''
In Python.org, I was intereted in the "Community" section which would allow me to connect with other Python enthusiasts.
Moreover, the "Success Stories" and "News" sections keep me updated on the languageâ€™s applications and developments.
It is a very useful tool for all levels of coders. I can't wait to use it.
