# Problems I want to tackle as I continue to improve:

'''
I want to explore more data sets going forward. Similarly, I would like to 
build an app where users can upload their data and visualize them with graphs 
and charts.

I have experience working as a multi-media manager for a business. 
Therefore, I am curious about how social media can be used to determine  
public sentiment about specific topics. I think this will be useful for 
businesses to gauge their audience with the help of natural language processing.

As for an immediate goal, I want to create a personal finance tracker for 
myself as a side project. I would like to see how my economics background
can merge with my coding skills in Python.
